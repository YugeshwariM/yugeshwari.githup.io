    <label><strong>Features of java explained</strong></label>
    <pre>
        Java is a popular programming language with many features, including: 
        <h3><strong> Object-oriented</strong></h3>
        Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means that code
        is organized around classes and objects, rather than functions and commands. 
        <h3><strong>Multithreading</strong></h3>
        Java supports multithreading, which allows programs to process multiple threads simultaneously. 
        This feature improves CPU and memory utilization, and can save time and money. 
       <h3> <strong> Platform independence</strong></h3>
        Java is portable and can run on any operating system that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. 
        This means that Java code can be written for one platform and easily transferred to another. 
        <h3><strong>Automatic memory management</strong></h3>
        Java automatically manages memory, which helps to reduce the risk of system crashes. 
        <h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>
        Java is known for its security features, which can help to create virus-free systems.

    <label><strong>What is Full Stack Developer?</strong></label>
    <pre>
        Full stack development is the process of developing both the frontend and backend of applications.
        Any application has a frontend (user-facing) component and a backend (database and logic) component.
        The frontend contains the user interface and code related to user interactions with the application.
        A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build both the front end and the back end of
        a website. The front end (the parts of a website a user sees and interacts with) and the back end
